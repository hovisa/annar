# annar
Chooses random card from a standard deck of cards. Can either show suit, face, value, or all three.
You pick two variables. The first variable (1 through 52) chooses which card you picked. The second variable (1 through 3 
or leave it blank) shows which part of the card is read; by leaving a blank space, all parts of the card are read.
